On that demo you can stream your unity screen out.
in order to do so we have to do several things.

1. on the scene we add the "CaptureScreen" script to the camera/ use the "CameraStreamer" prefab.
2. we add the "StreamToTransmiter" prefab to the scene.

on the play time we need a running server in the backround.

we need run RunNginx.bat("UnityMediaStreaming-master\UnityMediaStreaming-master\Tools\nginx-server-gryphon\RunNginx.bat")
you need to check that the prosses nginx running at the task manneger.

when all of the above is ready we can play are scene.

in order to be sure are stream is working we added a ffmpeg player for you under "rtmp-StreamOut.bat"
("UnityMediaStreaming-master\UnityMediaStreaming-master\Tools\ffmpeg\þþrtmp-StreamOut.bat")
